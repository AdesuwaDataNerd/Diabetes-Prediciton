# Diabetes Prediction with Ensemble Methods

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using ensemble methods, specifically the Bagging Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to leverage the strengths of ensemble learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of diabetes predictions. The project also explores the effectiveness of combining ensemble methods with SVM for medical diagnosis.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Bagging Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier with SVM for diabetes prediction.
- Analyzes medical data to identify patterns related to diabetes.
- Investigates the ensemble approach for enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Introduction

Accurate prediction of diabetes is crucial for early diagnosis and effective management of the condition. This project employs ensemble methods, specifically the Bagging Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier, combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict diabetes based on medical data. The ensemble approach aims to improve the robustness and generalization of the predictive model.

### Why Ensemble Methods with SVM?

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to achieve better predictive performance than individual models. Bagging reduces variance, and AdaBoost focuses on misclassified samples. Combining these with SVM, known for effective classification in high-dimensional spaces, creates a powerful framework for diabetes prediction.

### Goals

- Implement Bagging Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier with SVM for diabetes prediction.
- Utilize medical data, including features related to diabetes risk factors.
- Evaluate the performance of the ensemble models using metrics like accuracy and recall.
- Provide insights into the effectiveness of ensemble methods for medical diagnosis.
